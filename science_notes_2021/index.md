`GLHF`

## Formula

Use **SI Unit** when using formulas
***


I = Q/T

I = Ampere [A]
Q = Coulomb [C]
t = seconds [s]


***

V = IR

V = Volt [V]
I = Ampere [A]
R = ohm [Ω]

***


E = Pt

E = joule [J]
P = watt [W]
t = seconds [s]

Power stations sell electricity in 
E = kWh
P = kW
t  = h



## Magnification

Current → Rate of flow of Charges

***

**(k)g**


kilo = 10^3
50 kg
50 10^3 g  


**(m)A**


m = 10^-3
2.0 mA
2.0 10^(-3)A


## Current

**Ammeter** will always be in **Series**

**Potential difference(p.d)** is calculated by **voltmeter** and must be connected in parallel

**E.M.F** is there only for `Energy sources`
`Energy sources` are `Cells`, `battery` and `power supply`

## Effective resistance

**Effective Resistance has to be lower than the smallest resister** 

***

`When connected in Series, Current is the constant, Voltage is proportional`
`When connected in Parallel, Current is the totalVoltage/Resistance, Voltage is constant`

***

**Series**
`R1 + R2 + R3 …+ Rn`
**Parallel**
`1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 … + 1/Rn`

Example:  
1/R = 1/5 + 1/8
1/R = 13/40
13R = 40
R = 40/13 
  = 3.1 Ω (2.sf)

## Proportions
When length increases, Resistance also increases
Both Length and Resistance are directly proportional

`When A increases, Resistance decreases. Both A and Resistance are inversely proportional.`

***

`p.d across the conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided the physical conditions stay constant`
> Example of conditions = temperature

***

**If it is directly proportional, it must pass through the origin (0, 0) in a graph.**

***

## Switches/Fuses

`Live` wire's voltage > `neutral` wire's voltage 

***

The `switch` should be on the `live wire` 
The `fuse` should also be on the  `live wire`

`Fuse` must be a `integer`


Example: 

Current  = 2.3A
Fuse rating will be 3A

Fuse be the value rounded-up

***

### Normal Voltage

Live: 3.2A
Neutral: 3.2A
Earth: 0A

***

### Colours

Live: Brown
Neutral: Blue
Earth: Green and Yellow
